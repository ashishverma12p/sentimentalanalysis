           <h1>Sentiment analysis is a technique through which you can analyze a piece of text to determine the sentiment behind it. It combines machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to achieve this.For example, you can use sentiment analysis to analyze customer feedback. After collecting that feedback through various mediums like Twitter and Facebook, you can run sentiment analysis algorithms on those text snippets to understand your customers' attitude towards your product</h1>

        <h1>ANALYSIS EMOTIONS USING PRODUCT REVIEWS</h1>
        <p>Customer feedback analysis is the most widespread application of sentiment analysis. Direct customer feedback is gold for businesses, especially startups. Accurate audience targeting is essential for the success of any type of business.

            Well-made sentiment analysis algorithms can capture the core market sentiment towards a product.
            
            You can also extend this use case for smaller sub-sections, like analyzing product reviews on your Amazon store. The more customer-driven a company is, the better sentiment analysis can be of service.</p>
